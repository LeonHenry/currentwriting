Dark/Light kill some time

You’ve been listening to the same single for the last three weeks.  What started as a listen here and listen there turned into an hour out of the day then everyday and now its been weeks. Admit it, your life has fallen into a pattern. Maybe you like it that way, if thats the case then what fllows isn’t for you - don’t read it. 

Would you believe me if I said this was only the skeleton? Your chewing on bones. The real meat is at the show.  Whatever you like about this album its even better live and thats no exageration.

Catchiness, the haunting kind - beauty in the ugly. Loving (hugging?) the rough edges. Groove and melody in blood and guts. Light at the end of the tunnel. Joy tinged with dread. Dark slash light.

Whats punk about? Who knows anymore. Lets leave it at “its different for eveyerbody” but if you’re familiar with the kind of loneliness that permeates a crowd of strangers only to be overcome by a collective elusive groove, this is for you. Punk rock? No, this is mutant music - so get down with your mutant way with your mutant friends. Give it a try but don’t expect to stop - its addicting.
